#  An evolutionary algorithm to solve the 10 Queens Puzzle
it has f main components:
Initialisation
Mutation
Crossover
Fitness Evaluation

The 10 Queens Puzzle is a classic problem in mathematics and 
computer science that involves placing 10 chess queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
This means that no two queens can be placed in the same row, column, or diagonal.

and in further imrovements, I am experincing with different techniques like:
Mutation (an improved operator compared to Assignment 2)
Parent Selection
Survivor Selection
Measuring Population Diversity (often useful for termination criteria and analysing a GA's performance)

to get better results for my puzzle.
